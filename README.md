##Challenge 1

- I used class row in the begining, because container ist't nessesary.
- With CSS it will look the same, but here it's only HTML, and I think it's more important to write titles in h1 tag, and sub-titles in h2, h3 or h4 tags.
- I used align classes to make text right where I want to be.
- With using Foundation Zurb grid system I placed the cards in a row, and used small class because it's per 1.
- Classes align-top and align-spaced I used for vertical align on the cards and to have space between them.
- To make three items I used card class and in it I put grid system again.
- It's no specific class for images to round their border, but it's easy to do that with border-radius.

##Challenge 2

- I used Bootstrap 4 for this task. Mostly grid system, and for one button.
- Responsive design is by Bootstrap grid and custom media queries.
